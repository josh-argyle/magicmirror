## MagicMirror² is black without content

If you cannot access your MagicMirror² (black screen), check the params `address` and `ipWhitelist` in your 
`config.js`, see [this forum post](https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/1326/ipwhitelist-howto).

You should try the following parameters if you have problems:

```javascript
var config = {
	address: "0.0.0.0",
	port: 8080,
	ipWhitelist: [],
  ...
```

## How to install OS dependencies needed by a module?

You have 3 choices:

### Build your own image

This is the preferred solution if you need a lot of dependencies and start time of MagicMirror² matters. Here an example Dockerfile for [MMM-GoogleCast](https://github.com/ferferga/MMM-GoogleCast):

```bash
FROM karsten13/magicmirror:latest

USER root

RUN set -e; \
    apt-get update; \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -qy --allow-unauthenticated install python3 python3-pip; \
    pip3 install pychromecast --break-system-packages; \
    apt-get clean; \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*; \
    python3 --version;

USER node
```

### Use a start script

This is the preferred solution if you need only a few dependencies and start time of MagicMirror² doesn't matter. For this you have to write a `start_script.sh` file which can be used inside the container.

Here an example for the content of `start_script.sh`. If you want to use e.g. [MMM-ServerStatus](https://github.com/XBCreepinJesus/MMM-ServerStatus) you need to install the missing `ping` command. This is done by this `start_script.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
apt-get update
apt-get install -y iputils-ping
```

#### Option1: Config directory

You can add the `start_script.sh` beside the `config.js` on the host (in `~/magicmirror/mounts/config`). Because the `apt-get` command require root access you must add

```yaml
    user: root
```

to your `compose.yaml`.

#### Option2: Additional volume mount

Put the `start_script.sh` file beside your `compose.yaml` file. Additionally the `start_script.sh` file must be mapped into the container so you need to add a `volumes` section to your `compose.yaml` file (and add the root user to be able to install packages):

```yaml
    user: root
    volumes:
      - ./start_script.sh:/opt/magic_mirror/start_script.sh
```

### Use the `fat` image

Since release `v2.17.1` a new image `karsten13/magicmirror:fat` is provided. This image is based on `debian:latest` (not on `debian:slim` as the other images) and contains already many dependencies, e.g. python. You can try this image if you need packages missing in the normal images. Be aware that this image is really `fat` so pulling this image takes longer, especially on a raspberry pi.

## How to start MagicMirror² without using `compose.yaml` files?

If you don't want to use `compose.yaml` files you can start and stop your container with `docker run` commands. For starting the container you have to translate the `compose.yaml` file into a `docker run ...` command. As the `compose.yaml` contains includes you can show the expanded content by running `docker compose config`.

Here an example, `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
include:
  - includes/${MM_INIT}.yaml
  - includes/${MM_MMPM}.yaml
  - includes/${MM_LABWC}.yaml
  - includes/${MM_WATCHTOWER}.yaml

services:
  magicmirror:
    container_name: mm
    restart: always
    extends:
      file: includes/base.yaml
      service: ${MM_SCENARIO}_${MM_INIT}
```

Expanded `compose.yaml`, output of `docker compose config`:

```yaml
name: run
services:
  magicmirror:
    container_name: mm
    image: karsten13/magicmirror:latest
    networks:
      default: null
    ports:
      - mode: ingress
        target: 8080
        published: "8080"
        protocol: tcp
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /mnt/z/k13/magicmirror/mounts/config
        target: /opt/magic_mirror/config
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
      - type: bind
        source: /mnt/z/k13/magicmirror/mounts/modules
        target: /opt/magic_mirror/modules
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
      - type: bind
        source: /mnt/z/k13/magicmirror/mounts/css
        target: /opt/magic_mirror/css
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
networks:
  default:
    name: run_default
```

Corresponding `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run  -d \
    --publish 8080:8080 \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --volume ~/magicmirror/mounts/config:/opt/magic_mirror/config \
    --volume ~/magicmirror/mounts/modules:/opt/magic_mirror/modules \
    --volume ~/magicmirror/mounts/css:/opt/magic_mirror/css \
    --name mm \
    karsten13/magicmirror:latest
```

You can stop and remove the container with `docker rm -f mm`.

> You can look for online tools where you can paste the content of your expanded `compose.yaml` which gives you the corresponding `docker run ...` commands, e.g. [decomposerize](https://www.decomposerize.com/).

## How to patch a file of MagicMirror?

You may want to test something or fix a bug in MagicMirror² and therefore you want to edit a file of the MagicMirror² installation.
With a classic install this is no problem, just edit the file, save it and restart MagicMirror.

In a container setup this is not so simple. You can login into the container with `docker exec -it mm bash` and edit the file there.
This solution works as long as no restart of MagicMirror² is required. After a restart your changes are gone ...

So how to handle this?

The short story: Copy the file from inside the container to a directory on the host. Add a volume mount to the `compose.yaml` which mounts the local file back into the container. Now you can edit the file on the host and the changes are provided to the container. No problem if you need to restart the container.

The long story with example: In MagicMirror² v2.11.0 was a bug which stops the MMM-Remote-Control to work ([see](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control/issues/185#issuecomment-608600298)). So to solve this problem we patched the file `js/socketclient.js`.

To get the file from the container to the host (the container must be running) goto `~/magicmirror/run` and execute `docker cp mm:/opt/magic_mirror/js/socketclient.js .`

Now the file `socketclient.js` is located under `~/magicmirror/run`, you can do a `ls -la` to control this.

You can now edit this file and do your changes.

For getting the changes back into the container you have to edit the `compose.yaml` and insert a new volume mount under `volumes:`:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./socketclient.js:/opt/magic_mirror/js/socketclient.js
```

Thats it. If you need to restart the MagicMirror2 container just execute `docker compose up -d`.

## My container doesn't start

If an error occurs which force MagicMirror² to quit then this will restart the container again and again. You can try to catch the logs with `docker logs mm` but this is not really a solution.

For debugging you can add a `command` section in your `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
    command: 
      - sleep
      - infinity
```

and restart the container with `docker compose up -d`. Then you can login into the container with `docker exec -it mm bash`. You are by default in the MagicMirror² directory (`/opt/magic_mirror`). From here you can start the mirror with `npm run server` in server-only mode or with `npm run start` on your raspberry pi. Now you can examine the logs to catch the errors.

## Error: Cannot find module `request`

With MagicMirror² Version v2.16.0 the dependency `request` was removed. `request` is deprecated and should not be used anymore (see [npm request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)). This should be no problem for modules using `request` but some modules didn't setup `request` in there own `package.json`, they did rely on that this dependency comes with MagicMirror.

So if your container doesn't start with MagicMirror² v2.16.0 or later and you find something like `Error: Cannot find module 'request'` you should open an issue in the module project to get this fixed.

Example log of module MMM-quote-of-the-day:
```bash
[22.07.2021 12:16.03.454] [LOG]   Starting MagicMirror: v2.16.0

[22.07.2021 12:16.03.474] [LOG]   Loading module helpers ...
[22.07.2021 12:16.03.497] [ERROR] WARNING! Could not load config file. Starting with default configuration. Error found: Error: Cannot find module 'request'
Require stack:

- /opt/magic_mirror/serveronly/index.js
[22.07.2021 12:16.03.499] [LOG]   Loading module helpers ...

[22.07.2021 12:16.03.514] [ERROR] Error: Cannot find module 'request'
Require stack:
- /opt/magic_mirror/modules/MMM-quote-of-the-day/node_helper.js
- /opt/magic_mirror/js/app.js
- /opt/magic_mirror/serveronly/index.js
```

To get your MagicMirror² running you can use the following workaround:
- if your container doesn't start see the section above
- login into the container with `docker exec -it mm bash` and navigate into the folder of the module, e.g. `cd modules/MMM-quote-of-the-day`
- check with `ls -la` if the folder contains a file `package.json`, if not run `npm init -y`
- run `npm install request`

After this manual install of `request` the module should work.

This fix is persistent because the `modules` folder is mounted to the host. If you do a fresh install of such a module you have to repeat this procedure.

## Running on a raspberry pi ends with a white or black screen after a while

I had this behavior running the module `MMM-RAIN-MAP` which is fetching a greater amount of images for the map. So if you are running modules which needs a greater amount of shared memory, you have to increase `shm_size` in the `compose.yaml`. The default used is `shm_size: "256mb"` so if you need a higher value add a new line

```yaml
services:
  magicmirror:
    shm_size: "512mb"
```

in `compose.yaml` and restart the container with `docker compose up -d`.
