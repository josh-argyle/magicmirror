## Config, Modules, and custom CSS

After the first start of the container you find 3 directories
```bash
~/magicmirror/mounts/config
~/magicmirror/mounts/modules
~/magicmirror/mounts/css
```

`config` contains the `config.js`, you find more information [here](https://docs.magicmirror.builders/getting-started/configuration.html#general).

You can also use a `config.js.template` instead which can contain environment variables (this is not possible in `config.js`).
This make sense for keeping secrets (e.g. passwords, api keys) out of the config file. In `config.js.template` you can use shell variable syntax e.g. `${MY_SECRET}` as placeholder for your secrets. Don't forget to pass variables in `config.js.template` as environment variables to the container:
```yaml
    environment:
      MY_SECRET: "abc"
```

You can also use the `.env` file (in the same directory as your `compose.yaml`) to define your secrets there, for more info on this see [the docker compose reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/).

> 👉 When the container starts, the `config.js` will be created using the `config.js.template`. An existing `config.js` will be overwritten and saved as `config.js-old`

For installing modules refer to the module website, the default modules are described [here](https://docs.magicmirror.builders/modules/introduction.html).

> There is one difference installing or updating modules compared to a standard setup: You must do the `git clone ...`, `git pull` and `npm install` commands from inside the running container. For this you execute `docker exec -it mm bash` and in this shell you navigate to the `modules/MMM-...` folder. For exiting from the container you type `exit`.

`css` contains the `custom.css` file, which you can use to override your
modules' appearance. CSS basics are documented
[here](https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/6808/css-101-getting-started-with-css-and-understanding-how-css-works), among many other places.

## Default Modules

The default modules of MagicMirror² are located in the subfolder `modules/default`. These modules are maintained in the MagicMirror² project and not - as other modules - in own git repositories. Because the folder `modules` is mounted on the host this setup creates a symlink for the `default` folder which points to a location inside the container (containing the `default` stuff of the repository).

If someone does not agree with this procedure he can avoid the symlinking process by setting the environment variable `MM_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_MODULES` to `false` in the `.env` file:
```bash
MM_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_MODULES="false"
```

If you choose `MM_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_MODULES="false"` you must provide your own version of the `default` folder as subfolder under `~/magicmirror/mounts/modules` on the host.

## Timezone

The container tries to get the timezone by location. If this is not possible or wrong, you can set the timezone to a different value by editing the `compose.yaml` file. You have to add the timezone as environment variable:

```yaml
    environment:
      TZ: Europe/Berlin
```

## Mouse cursor

The mouse cursor is diabled by default. You can enable it by setting the environment variable `MM_SHOW_CURSOR` to `true` in your `.env` file:
```bash
MM_SHOW_CURSOR="true"
```
